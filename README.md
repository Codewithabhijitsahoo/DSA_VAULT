# Revise Wise Zone 📝

Revise Wise Zone is an advanced platform designed to streamline the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) preparation process. It provides developers with a powerful set of tools to track progress, receive automated question suggestions from LeetCode, and manage structured revision notes.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Unified Dashboard
- **Analytics at a Glance**: View your daily, weekly, and monthly progress through interactive charts.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor the number of questions solved across different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Recent Activity**: Quick access to your latest solved problems and updates.

### 2. Comprehensive Question Management
- **Add & Edit Questions**: Log new problems with detailed fields including Title, Problem Statement, Topic, Difficulty, Platform, and Code.
- **Integrated Code Editor**: A built-in Monaco Editor (VS Code core) to save and review your solutions in your preferred programming language.
- **Smart Categorization**: Tag questions and filter them by difficulty, topic, or status (Solved, Pending, Revisit).

### 3. LeetCode Integration 🚀
- **Automated Lookup**: Simply enter a question title, and Revise Wise Zone will automatically fetch the difficulty, problem URL, and unique question ID directly from LeetCode using a serverless Edge Function.
- **Syncing with Platforms**: Keep your internal tracker in sync with your LeetCode profile seamlessly.

### 4. Personal Mastery Notebook
- **Categorized Notes**: Create structured notes for algorithms, design patterns, or specific data structures.
- **The Revision Filter**: Easily mark questions that "Need Revision" and access them instantly during your study sessions.

### 5. Public Feed & Community
- **Shared Success**: Browse public questions added by other users to discover new problems and learning resources.
- **Global Search**: Search through a shared library of DSA problems to broaden your knowledge.

## 🛠️ How it Works

1. **Onboarding**: Users sign up or log in via Supabase Auth. A unique profile is automatically generated to store their preferences and progress.
2. **Problem Logging**: When you solve a problem on LeetCode or any other platform, you "Add Question" in Revise Wise Zone. Use the **Auto-fill** feature to quickly pull metadata.
3. **Drafting Solutions**: Write or paste your best solution in the integrated code editor. Add explanations and time/space complexity for future reference.
4. **Revision Cycle**: As you practice, mark challenging problems for revision. The dashboard will remind you of what needs your attention most.
5. **Insights**: Use the analytics tools to visualize your consistency and identify areas of improvement.
